## Personal profile and professional goals

<div align="justify">

**Backend developer** at *UbiSafe/Orsegups Participações S/A*.

Backend software developer working on project development using, among other technologies, **Java**, **Spring Framework**, **Spring Boot**, **RESTful APIs**, **relational databases** (such as MySQL), **Rust**, **Python**, **JavaScript/TypeScript**, **Docker**, **Linux**, **Redis**, **AWS SQS**, **Amazon S3**, **messaging with Apache Kafka and Kinesis**, **unit and integration tests**, **microservices architecture** and **AWS Lambda** (serverless computing).

I am proficient in using several tools, such as code control with git, various compilers and assemblers, such as GNU Compiler Collection, flat assembler (fasm), NASM and GNU as, as well as virtualization and emulation tools, such as Docker, VirtualBox and QEMU. I have experience in implementing projects using several languages, the main ones being: Java, Python, x86 Assembly, JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, CSS, C and shell scripts (see my open source projects below, in the [Projects and portfolio](#projects-and-portfolio) section). Experience in managing and documenting open source projects and in the use and administration of Unix-like systems. I have been continuously improving myself in **Java**, **Rust**, **Python**, **C**, **x86 Assembly**, **JavaScript/TypeScript**, **HTML** and **CSS** and since 2015 I have been developing an original operating system project (Hexagonix, which you can find below, in the [Projects and portfolio](#projects-and-portfolio) section) completely written in x86 Assembly, as well as others low-level projects.

I am graduating in Systems Analysis and Development (*Análise e Desenvolvimento de Sistemas - ADS*) from the *Pontifícia Universidade Católica de Minas Gerais* (PUC Minas, Brazil). I have a technical course in IT, where I became familiar with the notions of programming logic, C, Java, Pascal, Delphi, VisualBasic, hardware, robotics, web development, relational databases and SQL, systems analysis and entrepreneurship. I worked as a IT and technology democratization instructor, alongside the federal government program Telecentros.BR. I worked as a freelancer in software development (using Java and C with integration to MySQL databases) and computer maintenance. Furthermore, I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences from the *Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais* (UFMG, Brazil), with an emphasis on Biotechnology and Health, with a focus on the areas of Bioinformatics, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and I have an academic master's degree (stricto sensu) in Health Sciences by the *Instituto René Rachou/Fiocruz Minas* (Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Brazil). See my [academic background](#academic-background) below.

I am interested in preservation, documentation and emulation of historical software, having a large collection of operating systems collected over the years. See other [interests](#interests) and [other relevant information about me](#other-relevant-information-about-me) below.

* Assembly:

  - [**Hexagonix OS**](https://github.com/hexagonix) | **2015-currently**

    - Hexagonix is ​​a simple and lightweight operating system, Unix-like and completely developed in x86 Assembly. Hexagonix is ​​composed by a simple monolithic kernel, called Hexagon, shell, Unix-like utilities developed in Assembly and libraries for the development of other utilities. In addition, it is self-hosting, with a port of the fasm assembler (flat assembler), the same used for its construction. It operates in 32-bit protected mode, with FAT16 support, Pentium III or higher processors and 32 MB of RAM or more. It can be installed on a physical machine, running natively. The system aims to be simple and fast, based on some concepts of the Unix philosophy, in addition to being licensed under the BSD-3-Clause license, a permissive free software license. At the moment, all the project documentation is in Portuguese and English, while the code and code comments are in English only. Hexagonix has extensive documentation covering many system, language, and hardware features. Documentation can be found [here](github.com/hexagonix/Doc). The project also aims to be an educational tool, with well-documented code.

    - PX-DOS is derived from an older version of a DOS system, the Public Domain Operating System (PDOS). PX-DOS adds new layers, abstractions and functions on top of PDOS and extends its functionality. Several new utilities (userland) have also been added to the base system. System components were divided into repositories. We have the repository which contains the kernel, boot loader and shell, which contains the system init (user mode) and system utilities. We also have the repository with the assembly and libc development libraries.

  - [**PXBAS**](https://github.com/felipenlunkes/PXBAS) | **2011-2013**

    - PXBAS is a simple BASIC interpreter for MS-DOS, FreeDOS, PX-DOS, PDOS and compatibles. It may work on 32-bit versions of Windows.

    - FilmPlay is a small project developed to obtain movie information using the [OMDb](https://www.omdbapi.com/) API. To get the information via HTTP request, FilmPlay uses the GSON library to serialize and deserialize the JSON sent as a response. Application libraries and build are managed by Gradle.

  - [**Java Power Shell (JpS)**](https://github.com/felipenlunkes/Java-Power-Shell) | **2013**

    - Varied Java projects using SQL databases and Java methods.

* Markdown:

  - [**osdev**](https://github.com/felipenlunkes/osdev) | **2021-currently**

    - osdev is a project that aims to catalog and obtain more information about active open source operating system projects, as well as providing selected material that can help in the development of independent operating system projects. Therefore, all projects are classified according to operating system family, target architecture, whether they are available on GitHub or not, whether they are active (with commits less than 4 years old) and software license. In addition, the repository seeks to raise and organize historical material on the most used operating systems or those that revolutionized computing, such as UNIX.

  - [**My Resume**](https://github.com/felipenlunkes/cv/tree/main/resumes) | **2022-2023**

  - Use of Python to create a frontend for tools that run on the command line. Mainly using Tkinter and derivatives, targeting Linux and FreeBSD (WSL on Windows is also supported);
  - Creating small programs to study algorithms in Python;

* Shell script:

  - [**freebsd-config**](https://github.com/felipenlunkes/freebsd-config) | **2022-currently**

    - The project relies on a shell script designed to automate the installation of various packages after installing FreeBSD. By default, installing FreeBSD does not install graphics and network drivers, as well as GNU utilities and a GUI. The script aims to automate network and graphics configuration, ask the user to choose one of several graphical environments to install and install GNU tools, such as bash and nano, for example.

  - [**Run Ancient UNIX**](https://github.com/felipenlunkes/run-ancient-unix) | **2022-currently**

    - This project/repository aims to facilitate the execution of old versions of UNIX, developed for discontinued architectures, such as PDP-11. This includes the Version 1 UNIX, Version 5 UNIX, and Version 7 UNIX historical versions. The project includes a script and a Python frontend responsible for downloading disk images of old UNIX versions, as well as preparing these images to run on modern architectures.

#### Sorted by other technologies

* Linux:

  - Netuno OS | **2012-2014**

    - During 2012, motivated to learn more about how a modern operating system works, I started to develop a small and simple Linux distribution, choosing to maintain a command line interface. For that, I followed the steps proposed by the Linux From Scratch project. The result was Netuno OS, an operating system based on the 2.6 series Linux kernel, standard tools and utilities. There are no sources other than those available for the packages used, so a repository had not been created at the time. What was left of it was an installation image of the system, approximately 192 MB, dated 2012 and updated in 2014. At the moment, I also developed some kernel modules to study the interfaces and use of the /proc directory.
